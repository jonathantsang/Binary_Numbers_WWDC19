 ## Conversion from Binary to Decimal
 
 - callout(Goal):
 Learn about the differences between a decimal number and a binary number.
 
 Now that we know how to convert from decimal numbers to binary numbers, how do we do it in the other direction?
 - - -
 
 - Example:
 How is 23 represented in base 10?
 
 2 * 10 + 3 * 10 = 23
 
 Where 23 contains two tens and three ones to form 23.
 
 We can also represent 23 using powers of 10.
 
 2 * 10^1 + 3 * 10^0 = 23
 
 We notice here that the ones digit 3 is multiplied by 10^0 and the tens digit 2 is multiplied by 10^1, and each increasing column in the number would be multiplied by 10 to an increasing exponent.
