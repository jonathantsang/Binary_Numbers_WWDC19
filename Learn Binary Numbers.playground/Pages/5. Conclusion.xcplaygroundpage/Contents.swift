 ## Conclusion
 
 - Note:
 What did we learn in these short lessons?
 
 - What a base 10 and base 2 number is, and the differences between them
 - How to convert to base 2 from base 10 and vice versa
 - Learned about characters and their ASCII number representation
 
 There are many more topics for learning beyond in this area of number theory with topics:
 
 - Even more number systems beyond base 2 and base 10, with base 16 known as hexadecimal, base 8 known as octal, and more
 - AND, OR, XOR, and other bit operators that operate on binary numbers. How you can change a number based on which 0s and 1s it possesses.
 - Bit shifting in binary numbers to count the number of bits, find patterns in the bits, and more
